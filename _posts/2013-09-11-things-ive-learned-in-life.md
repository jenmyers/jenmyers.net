title: 34 Things I've Learned in Life that I Want to Tell My Daughter
summary: A list.
---

A couple of weeks ago, I traveled across Chicago to pick my eight-year-old daughter up from the airport. She hadn't been gone that long and I don't remember, at the time, feeling particularly poetic about her growth. But, on the way there, I found myself composing a list on my phone of all the things I wanted her to know when she grew up. The things that I had learned after a long period of making mistakes, hurting and trying again.

I posted the first verison of this list immediately on the internet, because the internet is my scrapbook. Over the next few days, however, I kept thinking of other little things I wish I had included. So I revised the list and am posting it here now. Because the internet is my scrapbook.

She's only eight. She's not ready to understand these. I know that I'm posting this now not for her own growth but for mine. Even after you learn something, you run the risk of forgetting it if you don't keep reminding yourself how important the lesson was.

These are in an order, but not a particular one.

1. Have your own money. Safety, security and even opportunity bought by someone else is a poor substitute for pride in earning your own life.

2. Nothing external can make you happy. However, the right external factors will enable you to find it internally.

3. Say yes, then figure out how.

4. Don’t tolerate people who claim to care about you but don’t believe in your potential enough to support your growth.

5. Don’t be afraid of being alone. Lack of self-respect is far worse than loneliness, and when you like and respect yourself, you’re never really lonely.

6. No matter what you do and say, someone somewhere is going to judge you for it. So fuck it and be yourself.

7. Be willing to do the long, hard, devastating work necessary to understand how to be yourself.

8. Being authentic and genuine is more important than having success on other people’s terms. Appearances are bullshit. Those who have traded integrity for convenience, who have told comforting lies and rationalized their mistakes and got away without consequences? They're not really happy. Don't compare what you have to what they have. Find your own integrity and hold on to it. It will bring you rewards in the end.

9. Be eagerly, clumsily, foolishly sincere. Don't retreat into detached coolness because other people make you feel ashamed or silly for expressing what you feel. It's their shame, not yours.

10. There is always a way. Always.

11. Human potential is the most important thing in the world. Honor your own. Respect others’.

12. There is nothing wrong in being pretty, or liking being pretty, but anyone who ties it to your self-worth isn’t worth your time.

13. If you get tattoos, make them good pieces from good artists in good shops. If I see any hack scratcher work, you’re grounded, no matter how old you are.

14. Learn to process your emotions healthily. They are nothing to be ashamed of, but they are to be managed. Not suppressed. Felt, processed, expressed, managed. They are not allowed to limit you and they are not allowed to hurt others.

15. Ask for help. Trust people who are worthy of it.

16. Don’t trust people who are not actualized enough to see you for who you are, rather than a reflection of their own needs and self-deceptions.

17. Don't fall in love with someone who doesn't love Springsteen.

18. Never forget where you come from.

19. You come from long years of hard work and rebellious dreams. You come from difficulty and stubbornness and the passionate refusal to give up on or compromise the belief that a fulfilled life is something we deserve. You come from women with purpose, strength, honor and pride.

20. One day when you were eight years old, you told me you were: "a princess, but also the best warrior." Damn right you are. Remember that.

21. Don't define yourself with negatives.

22. Empathize, empathize, empathize, emphasize, empathize. And behave accordingly.

23. You may someday convince yourself that you're being kind to others by not telling them the truth. You're not. All you're doing is robbing them of their own opportunities to grow and, even more importantly, you're avoiding your own responsibility to do the same.

24. Do what scares you. Don’t make excuses. Don’t run away.

25. Remember that the scariest stuff is not outside of you.

26. Own your own mistakes.

27. The world doesn’t like women who are too loud, too opinionated, too independent, too proud. Be these things anyway (all at once if you feel like it). Be prepared for the judgment. Be prepared to do it anyway and not complain.

28. No one owns you. Not one tiny bit.

29. Travel and explore. But don’t just move around for distraction or escape. Travel to see yourself differently, and grow.

30. It takes a while to learn how to use liquid eyeliner without making a mess. So don’t get discouraged. Unless you don’t care about eyeliner, in which case pass that tidbit on to someone else.

31. You are lucky. Help those who aren’t.

32. You can change anything in the world. You really can. Not everything there is. Not always a single thing to the degree you want. But never stop fighting because you think you are powerless. Find the thing you can do and do that. You can always change something.

33. Making yourself better is the best way to start making the world better.

34. Seriously, you can change anything. Stop thinking or whining or worrying about it and just go do it.
